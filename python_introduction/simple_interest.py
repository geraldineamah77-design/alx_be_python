# simple_interest.py

# Define the variables
principal = 1000    # Principal amount ($1000)
rate = 0.05         # Annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3            # Time in years

# Calculate simple interest using the formula I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
Add simple_interest.py to calculate simple interest
